# Migration 31 Implementation Results

## Issue Resolved: Function Signature Ambiguity

### Problem
The database had two versions of the `flag_card_for_review` function with different signatures:
1. **Old version**: `(p_card_id uuid, p_reason flag_reason, p_comment text)`
2. **New version**: `(p_card_id uuid, p_reason text, p_comment text)` 

This caused PostgreSQL to be unable to determine which function to call, resulting in the error:
```
Could not choose the best candidate function between: 
public.flag_card_for_review(p_card_id => uuid, p_reason => public.flag_reason, p_comment => text), 
public.flag_card_for_review(p_card_id => uuid, p_reason => text, p_comment => text)
```

### Solution
Dropped the old function version to leave only the enhanced Migration 31 version with:
- ✅ Input validation (card ID, reason, comment length)
- ✅ XSS protection with comment sanitization  
- ✅ User tier restrictions
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Enhanced security features

### Verification
```sql
-- Verified only one function remains
SELECT proname, pg_get_function_identity_arguments(oid) 
FROM pg_proc WHERE proname = 'flag_card_for_review';
-- Result: flag_card_for_review(p_card_id uuid, p_reason text, p_comment text)

-- Tested function security
SELECT flag_card_for_review(null, 'other', 'test');
-- Result: ERROR: User must be authenticated to flag cards (✅ EXPECTED)
```

## Migration 31 Status: ✅ SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED

### Enhanced Security Features Implemented:
1. **Input Validation**
   - Card ID requirement check
   - Reason validation against enum values
   - Comment length limit (500 chars)

2. **XSS Protection**
   - HTML tag removal
   - JavaScript protocol blocking
   - Data URI blocking
   - VBScript protocol blocking

3. **User Tier Restrictions**
   - Admin users blocked from using regular flagging
   - Only free/paid users can flag cards

4. **Database Integration**
   - Proper foreign key validation
   - User flag count increment
   - Enhanced error handling

### Test Suite Created
- `migration-31-security-test.html` - Security function tests
- `function-signature-test.html` - Function signature tests  
- `schema-integrity-test.html` - Database schema validation
- `migration-organization-test.html` - File organization tests
- `e2e-security-test.html` - End-to-end security tests
- `index.html` - Test suite dashboard

- ✅ All files backed up to `migration/backup/`
- ✅ Core migrations 01-12 remain in main directory
- ✅ Migration 31 applied successfully with corrected column reference
- ✅ **Duplicate migration files resolved**: 
  - Replaced old migrations 01-03 with current versions
  - Moved duplicate Migration 10 fix to archive
  - Renamed duplicate Migration 13 to 13b in archive
  - Removed extra Migration 31 copy from archive
