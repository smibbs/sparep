# GitHub Secrets Setup for Supabase

## üîê Setting Up GitHub Secrets

To fix the mobile authentication issue on nanotopic.co.uk, you need to add your Supabase credentials as GitHub Secrets so they can be injected during deployment.

### Step 1: Get Your Supabase Credentials

1. **Open your local `config/supabase-config.js` file**
2. **Copy the values** for:
   - `SUPABASE_URL` (looks like: `https://your-project.supabase.co`)
   - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (long string starting with `eyJ...`)

### Step 2: Add GitHub Secrets

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**: https://github.com/your-username/sparep
2. **Click "Settings"** tab (at the top of the repo)
3. **Click "Secrets and variables"** in the left sidebar
4. **Click "Actions"**
5. **Click "New repository secret"**

### Step 3: Create Two Secrets

**Secret 1:**
- **Name**: `SUPABASE_URL`
- **Value**: Your Supabase URL (e.g., `https://abcdefg.supabase.co`)

**Secret 2:**
- **Name**: `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` 
- **Value**: Your Supabase anonymous key (the long string)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Make sure the secret names are EXACTLY `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (case-sensitive)

### Step 4: Test the Deployment

1. **Commit and push** your changes (the updated deploy.yml)
2. **Go to Actions tab** in GitHub to watch the deployment
3. **Check the logs** - you should see: `‚úÖ Supabase config created successfully`
4. **Test nanotopic.co.uk/login.html** on mobile - the 404 error should be gone!

## üîç Verification

After deployment, the GitHub Action will:
1. ‚úÖ Create `config/supabase-config.js` during build
2. ‚úÖ Inject your credentials securely 
3. ‚úÖ Deploy to nanotopic.co.uk with the config file included

The file will be created automatically and won't appear in your repository (keeping secrets secure).

## üö® Security Notes

- ‚úÖ **Secrets are encrypted** in GitHub and only accessible during Actions
- ‚úÖ **Not visible in repository** or commit history
- ‚úÖ **Only used during deployment** to create the config file
- ‚úÖ **Config file never committed** to git (still in .gitignore)

## üìã Quick Checklist

- [ ] Found SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY in local config
- [ ] Added both secrets to GitHub repository settings
- [ ] Committed and pushed the updated deploy.yml workflow
- [ ] Watched GitHub Actions deployment complete successfully
- [ ] Tested https://nanotopic.co.uk/login.html - no more 404 error
- [ ] Mobile authentication now works on production

This approach keeps your credentials secure while ensuring the production site has the necessary configuration to authenticate users!
